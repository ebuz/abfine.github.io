<h1> Love story </h1>
<h3> by Alex B. Fine </h3>

<font face="courier">

I've heard that some men cry during sex, but I never have.

<br>
<br>

I heard that some women do too.  I only saw this happen once, but that was because while we were having sex I told her that her mother died.

<br>
<br>

I found out before we had sex, but I forgot to tell her then.

<br>
<br>


I meant to tell her during dinner, but the conversation meandered and was beyond my control.

<br>
<br>


I could have told her while we cleared the plates but I did not think of it then.

<br>
<br>

In the bathroom, looking in the mirror, I reminded myself to tell her.  But when I walked into the kitchen, intending to tell her, she was not there.

<br>
<br>


She was outside with the dog.

<br>
<br>


They stayed gone for many minutes.

<br>
<br>


While they were gone I cleaned the forks.  I ran the sponge along the tines of the forks and my mind wandered.

<br>
<br>


When she came back in she told me something funny the dog had done and I forgot to tell her about her dead mother.

<br>
<br>


And during a game of scrabble, news of her mother's death did not cross my mind when I scrabbled the word HEARSE for 10 points.  

<br>
<br>


After the game, as we bent the board and made all the wooden tiles slide into the center of the board and into the little silver bag, I was not reminded in any way of the handful of dirt that we'd later sprinkle onto the coffin containing her mother's body.

<br>
<br>


Nor did I think of her mother's death when we brushed our teeth, side by side, wearing the matching tank tops her mom bought for us at Myrtle Beach.

<br>
<br>

Nor did her mother's toothbrush, in the toothpaste-caked cup by the sink, remind me of the frailty of human life or anything like that.

<br>
<br>

And so it was that, after undressing each other in the dark; after pulling her panties down past her thighs and calves and off her feet; after running my thumb along the little creases left in her skin by the strap of the panties she had worn all day; after she removed the socks from my feet, exposing them to the cold bedroom air, causing me to draw my knees towards my chest, seeking warmth under the covers and against her bare thighs; after I slid my spread-out fingers into her thick auburn hair starting at the base of her skull; after I felt with my hand the smooth skin along the inside of the arch of her foot as she lifted and bent her leg and pressed it tightly against my side, only then did I remember and say, Sweetie the doctors did all they could.
